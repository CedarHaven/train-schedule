# Train-Schedule

This is a train scheduling thing. There's a form where you can enter a train name, destination, how frequently the train comes, and when the train starts coming (in military time), and then the table of trains is updated with the train's name, destination, the next time it's coming based on the current time, and how many minutes away it is based on what you entered. It runs on military time, meaning that there are no AM or PM markers on the schedule display.

This project uses Firebase to store data.
